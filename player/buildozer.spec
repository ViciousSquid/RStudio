# Buildozer configuration for the Fio Player (python-for-android).
#
# Build a debug APK from the repository root:
#     cd player && buildozer -v android debug
# The resulting APK lands in player/bin/.
#
# For a Google Play release build (signed AAB), set the (android.release)
# options below and run:  buildozer -v android release
#
# NOTE ON NATIVE DEPS: numpy and pyopengl have maintained p4a recipes. PyGLM is
# C++ and has no upstream recipe yet — see player/README.md ("Native dependency
# strategy") for the two supported paths (a local PyGLM recipe, or the pure-glm
# math shim). Keep `requirements` in sync with whichever path you choose.
