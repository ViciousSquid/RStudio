"""
Player-side plugin host.

Lets the standalone ``.fiopak`` player load and *run* the plugins a package
depends on — so a game built with, say, the Tidy plugin actually plays outside
the editor. It is the player-side counterpart to the editor's
``plugins.integration``: where the editor patches its logic thread to dispatch
the plugin lifecycle, this drives the same dispatch from the player's frame loop.

Responsibilities:

* **Load** the bundled plugins. If the app already ships the ``plugins``
  package (the Android build does), that copy is used; otherwise the plugins
  carried inside the package are extracted to a writable dir and imported.
* **Bridge** the player's free-look camera to the minimal ``logic`` interface
  plugin runtimes expect (``things`` / ``player`` / ``io_manager`` /
  ``current_hud_message``), building entity instances from the map's data.
* **Dispatch** ``on_play_start`` / ``on_tick`` / ``on_play_stop`` each frame.

Everything is guarded: if the plugin system isn't present or a package needs no
plugins, the host stays inert and the player runs exactly as before.

Note: the player's renderer is still bringing up map-geometry drawing, so plugin
*gameplay* runs here (state changes, HUD text) ahead of the visuals catching up
— ``things`` and ``hud_message`` are exposed for the renderer to consume once it
draws dynamic models.
