#### A brush-based CSG world editor inspired by QeRadiant and Worldcraft (from the old times!)

* Custom OpenGL/PyGame engine supports immediate "drop-in and play" (like CryEngine Editor)
* Real-time lighting with optional stencil shadows
* Volumetric fog
* `json` level format :-)
* Custom physics engine with configurable parameters
* Fully modular and open source (MIT License)
  
### Roadmap:
* Quake/Quake2/Quake3/Half-life map support
* OBJ model support (currently partially implemented)
* Visual scripting
* Terrain generation
