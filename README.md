#### A brush-based CSG world editor (and game engine) inspired by QeRadiant and Worldcraft (from the old times!)

* Custom OpenGL/PyGame engine _supports immediate "drop-in and play" (like CryEngine Editor)_
* Custom physics engine with configurable parameters
* Real-time lighting with optional stencil shadows
* Audio engine plays WAV files
* `json` level format :-)
* Volumetric fog

### Roadmap:
* Quake/Quake2/Quake3/Half-life map support
* OBJ model support (currently partially implemented)
* Visual scripting
* Terrain generation
