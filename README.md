#### A brush-based CSG world editor inspired by QeRadiant and Worldcraft (from the old times!)

* Custom OpenGL/PyGame engine supports immediate "drop-in and play" (like CryEngine Editor)
* Real-time lighting
* `json` level format :-)
* Fully modular and open source (MIT License)
  
### Roadmap:
* Quake/Half-life map support
* OBJ model support
* Physics
* Visual scripting
* Support for multiple genres of game
