Game Logic Processing

This thread runs game logic at a fixed timestep (60 Hz), handling:
- Player movement and physics
- Entity interactions and triggers
- I/O event dispatching
- Mover and door animations
- Pickup collection
- Player death detection
- Portal transit (Prey 2006-style world portals)

        they can't collide as an AABB.  Here we bake each solid angled brush into
        world-space collision triangles and flag it ``_collision_mode='mesh'`` —
        the exact format the player's collide-and-slide path already uses for
        models — so ramps and wedges collide correctly and you can walk up
        slopes.  Box brushes are left untouched and keep the fast AABB path.
